# Quora Duplicate Question Pairs Detector
[Live Demo ‚Üí Open the App](https://duplicatequestionpairs1.streamlit.app/)

## üéØ Objective
The objective of this project is to detect whether two given questions on **Quora** are semantically duplicate or not.  
This helps reduce redundant questions, improves search results, and enhances user experience

## üìñ Project Description  

Quora users often ask the same question in different ways:  

- *"How do I learn Python quickly?"*  
- *"What‚Äôs the fastest way to learn Python?"*  

Even though the wording differs, both mean the same.  

This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Feature Engineering**, and **Machine Learning** to identify such duplicate questions. A **Streamlit web app** makes it interactive and easy to use.  
## üìÇ Dataset  

We used the **Quora Question Pairs Dataset**, which contains:  

- `qid1`, `qid2`: Question IDs  
- `question1`, `question2`: The text of the questions  
- `is_duplicate`: Target label (1 = Duplicate, 0 = Not Duplicate)

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing  
- Lowercasing & punctuation removal  
- Contraction expansion (`you're ‚Üí you are`)  
- Stopword removal, tokenization  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering  
- **Token-based features**: word overlap, common word ratio  
- **Fuzzy matching features**: QRatio, PartialRatio, WRatio  
- **TF-IDF vectorization**: text embedding  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Modeling  
- Trained **LinearSVC** with tuned hyperparameters  
- Combined engineered features + TF-IDF vectors  
- Evaluated using **Accuracy, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix**  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment  
- Saved trained model as `model.pkl` and vectorizer as `cv.pkl`  
- Developed **Streamlit Web App** with simple UI  
- Deployed live on Streamlit Cloud
